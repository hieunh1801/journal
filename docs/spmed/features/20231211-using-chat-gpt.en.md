I. Introduction

A. Overview of MyDrugGene Application

The MyDrugGene application offers the following functionalities:

Access and review detailed reports from PGx services, including genetic analyses and optimal drug recommendations based on user genetics.

Support for users to input information about medications they are using. The application evaluates drug interactions and provides suggestions to avoid side effects.

Access to detailed information about medications provided by SPMED. The app directly connects with SPMED, ensuring user convenience in looking up information from active ingredients to potential side effects.

B. Integration of ChatGPT Objectives

The primary goal is to enhance user experience by providing a natural and direct information gateway. ChatGPT will act as a virtual assistant, facilitating users' easy and efficient access to information.

II. Features and Benefits

Natural Language Interaction:

Feature: Users can ask questions or engage in conversations with ChatGPT using natural language.

Example: "What medications are suitable for my genetics?"

Medication Information Retrieval:

Feature: Users can inquire about specific medication details from SPMED.

Example: "What is warfarin? What conditions does it treat?"

Predefined Questions and Choices:

Feature: ChatGPT can present predefined questions or options for users to choose from.

Examples:

"How can I view my PGx results on the app?"
"Can you help me understand the recommended medications based on my genetics?"
"I want to add a new medication to my favorites. How can I do this in the app?"
III. Drawbacks

Limited Contextual Understanding:

Drawback: ChatGPT may misunderstand context or provide inaccurate answers due to a lack of specific information.

Example: A user asks, "Does this medication have side effects?" ChatGPT may misinterpret which medication is being referred to.

Prone to Errors:

Drawback: In some cases, ChatGPT may generate undesired or inappropriate responses.

Example: ChatGPT might provide inaccurate information about the effects of a medication if not updated in its training data.

Limited Memory Capability:

Drawback: ChatGPT does not retain information across multiple questions, potentially leading to limited recall of interaction history.

Example: If a user asks, "What medications did I take yesterday?" and then follows up with "How did I feel yesterday?" ChatGPT might not link the two questions.

Complexity Handling Challenges:

Drawback: In scenarios requiring in-depth genetic analysis and personalized treatment recommendations, ChatGPT may fall short.

Example: If a user requests a thorough analysis of their genetics and customized treatment recommendations, ChatGPT may not provide sufficient detailed information.

Dependency on Training Data:

Drawback: ChatGPT relies heavily on training data; insufficiently diverse or inaccurate data can result in imprecise responses.

Example: If there is not enough data on a new medication, ChatGPT may struggle to provide comprehensive information about it.

Utilizing Unavailable Real-World Data:

Scenario: Our company lacks comprehensive information about a new medication on the market, making it absent from ChatGPT's training data.

Illustration 1:

User: "I am using the new medication ABC. Are there any side effects?"
ChatGPT (With Current Data): "I don't have detailed information about medication ABC. Please consult a healthcare professional."
Illustration 2:

User: "How does MyDrugGene analyze my genetics to provide PGx results?"
ChatGPT (With Current Data): "I apologize; I don't have detailed information about the internal processes of the MyDrugGene application."
IV. Conclusion

In today's context, integrating ChatGPT into our MyDrugGene application brings significant benefits. The natural language interaction feature, medication information retrieval, and overall user engagement contribute positively to users' understanding of their genetics and medications.

However, it's crucial to acknowledge the drawbacks. ChatGPT's reliance on training data poses challenges, and careful consideration is necessary for its use in healthcare settings where high precision is vital. To enhance ChatGPT's performance in the MyDrugGene application, updating and supplementing training data while providing more detailed insights into the app's operations is recommended. This approach ensures we harness the full potential of ChatGPT, delivering the best user experience while ensuring the information provided is accurate and reliable.
